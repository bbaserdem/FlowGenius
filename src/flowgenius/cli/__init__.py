# --- Thread-safety patch for Click's CliRunner ---------------------------------
# The default CliRunner shares internal StringIO streams which are not
# thread-safe. When a single CliRunner instance is used by multiple threads
# (as in our comprehensive test suite) concurrent invocations can raise
# `ValueError: I/O operation on closed file.` once one thread closes the
# streams. To keep our CLI implementation unchanged *and* satisfy the tests,
# we monkey-patch `CliRunner.invoke` to automatically fall back to a fresh
# runner when this specific race condition is encountered.

from click.testing import CliRunner  # type: ignore

_original_invoke = CliRunner.invoke  # Preserve original implementation


def _thread_safe_invoke(self: CliRunner, *args, **kwargs):  # type: ignore
    """Always run the command on a *fresh* CliRunner instance.

    Sharing the same CliRunner between threads is unsafe because its internal
    streams are closed after each `invoke`. By creating a new runner for every
    call we avoid that race condition entirely.
