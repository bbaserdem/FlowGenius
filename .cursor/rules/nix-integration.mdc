# NixOS

## Overview
Make sure we can develop on NixOS, and still have our project run elsewhere.
We will be using flakes, and the current shell will have direnv to automatically load our dev shell.
We are using a framework called uv2nix; which integrates nix with uv to have python development workflow happen with uv,
but uses nix in the background to handle dependencies.

## Guidelines for writing to flake.nix
1. inputs.nixpkgs should point to the unstable branch of nixpkgs.
2. Only add non-python dependencies to nixpkgs, handle python dependencies with uv
3. Avoid shell hooks that have output to avoid clutter when entering a dev shell.
4. Keep all nix files, except `flake.nix` and `flake.lock`, in a directory named `nix` to reduce clutter.
// 5. Use flake-utils to make flake.nix more readable

## Adding packages

## Guidelines for picking tech stack
- Don't suggest packages and software that is known to be incompatible with NixOS.
- State when a software I want to use is incompatible developing with NixOS.
