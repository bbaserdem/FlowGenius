# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Config Wizard
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the CLI command 'flowgenius wizard' to guide users through initial configuration setup.
# Details:
Use Click or Typer to create a CLI command that prompts the user for configuration details such as openai_key_path, projects_root, link_style, and default_model. Store these configurations in a YAML file located at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/flowgenius/config.yaml.

   - openai_key_path (Path)
   - projects_root (Path) 
   - link_style (Literal["obsidian", "markdown"])
   - default_model (str)

✅ **Configuration Manager**: Built `ConfigManager` class for YAML file operations:
   - Loads/saves config using ruamel.yaml
   - Handles Path object serialization/deserialization
   - Creates config directories automatically
   - Validates configuration data

✅ **CLI Structure**: Implemented Click-based CLI architecture:
   - Main CLI group with version option
   - Modular command structure for future expansion
   - Proper help text and documentation

✅ **Wizard Command**: Interactive `flowgenius wizard` command with:
   - Prompts for all required configuration options
   - Sensible default values (~/Learning, ~/.openai_api_key, etc.)
   - Input validation and confirmation dialogs
   - Directory creation when needed
   - Friendly user experience with emoji and clear messages
   - --force flag to overwrite existing config

✅ **Testing Verified**:
   - CLI help system working correctly
   - Wizard creates valid YAML config file at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/flowgenius/config.yaml
   - All prompts and validation working as expected
   - Projects directory creation successful
