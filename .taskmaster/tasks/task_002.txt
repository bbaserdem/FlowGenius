# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Config Wizard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the CLI command 'flowgenius wizard' to guide users through initial configuration setup.
# Details:
Use Click or Typer to create a CLI command that prompts the user for configuration details such as openai_key_path, projects_root, link_style, and default_model. Store these configurations in a YAML file located at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/flowgenius/config.yaml.

# Test Strategy:
Run the 'flowgenius wizard' command and verify that a valid config.yaml file is created with the correct user inputs.
