# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Initialize the project repository with necessary configurations and dependencies.
# Details:
Create a new Git repository for FlowGenius. Set up the project structure with directories for CLI commands, agents, and data models. Initialize a Nix flake for environment management. Add dependencies such as openai, langchain-core, click, platformdirs, pydantic-settings, ruamel.yaml, and textual (optional) to the Nix flake configuration.

Initial assessment of Task 1 progress:

✅ COMPLETED ITEMS:
- Git repository is already initialized (confirmed by git status)
- Nix flake is excellently configured with uv2nix integration, Python 3.13, and proper development shell
- Basic Python project structure exists with src/flowgenius/ and pyproject.toml
- Basic CLI entry point is defined (flowgenius = "flowgenius:main")

❌ REMAINING WORK:
- Add required dependencies to pyproject.toml: openai, langchain-core, click, platformdirs, pydantic-settings, ruamel.yaml, textual (optional)
- Create project directories for CLI commands, agents, and data models
- Update uv.lock with new dependencies
- Verify 'nix develop' works with all dependencies

NEXT STEPS:
1. Add dependencies to pyproject.toml
2. Create proper directory structure
3. Update dependencies and test environment
